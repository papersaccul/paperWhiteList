# Discord TS bot
shit code for my personal use

The lazy can use it as a base for their super-duper-mega bot by removing all my slag from /commands and piling on their own commands (all contents of the /command and /events folders are automatically read out)

## install
`git clone https://github.com/papersaccul/paper_bot3`
`cd paper_bot3`
`npm i`

## Start
U can create an .env.production file, to store the `BOT_TOKEN` variable, or pass it through docker

`docker-compose up -d`
or 
`npm start` 

## U can use dev mode, which will autorestart the bot when files are changed
`npm run dev`
